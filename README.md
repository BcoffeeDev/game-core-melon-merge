# 🍉 game-core-melon-merge

A Unity-based core system that replicates fruit merging mechanics inspired by popular falling and merging puzzle games.
This project focuses on recreating the core logic behind object merging using Rigidbody2D and built-in object pooling, all wrapped in a minimal and extensible structure.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Unity-native object pooling system
- ✅ Customizable fruit data (appearance & physics) via `MelonDataContainer`
- ✅ Ready-to-run demo scenes under `Scenes/Demo`

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Scripts/Runtime/`: Core merge logic and data containers
- `Scenes/Demo/`: Playable test scenes for validating functionality
- `Textures/`: Hand-drawn fruit sprites used in demo

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open it using **Unity 6 or later**
3. Load any scene under `Scenes/Demo`
4. Play the scene and drop fruit to observe merging behavior

> Note: This project may not work properly in Unity versions below 6 due to usage of modern API features.

---

## 🧩 Customization

You can define your own fruits, physics properties, and visual assets by editing the `MelonDataContainer` asset. This includes:

- Physical properties
- Appearance (sprite)

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Educational demos for Unity 2D physics & pooling
- Base system for prototyping fruit merging puzzle games
- Core system for commercial or personal projects (MIT-licensed)
